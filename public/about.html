<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Komal. I have over 5 years of professional experience as a Software Quality Analyst, where I developed a
  strong foundation in testing, debugging, and understanding the software development lifecycle. My journey in tech has
  sparked a deep interest in coding, and I'm now transitioning into Full Stack Development.

<p>
  This portfolio marks the beginning of my new path as a developer. I'm passionate about building user-friendly,
  responsive, and meaningful web applications that make a difference.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of coding, I love traveling to new places and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. Whether it's
  exploring a new destination or creating a delicious dish, I'm always eager to learn and try something new.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and growing in the world of web development!
